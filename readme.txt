Cleaning unusual characters (quotation marks, en-dashes and others) in Titles

== Description ==

If you write your articles in Microsoft Word prior pasting them to WordPress you probably need this plugin since Microsoft Word use Auto-Correct function to change the quotation marks or replace simple dashes to en-dash for example.

Also if you usually paste parts of the titles from other websites you might challenge the same issue.

This plugin will replace unusual characters in titles before saving them in order to have clean titles that will be better parsed by other websites and better indexed by search engine robots.
